# ID-development-blog
I ID has been an incredibly fun and rewarding experience. I have learnt a lot from it, and I hope to learn even more in the future.

The lessoon has been very useful for me in many ways. It has helped me to hone my coding skills, brush up on my coding knowledge, and even gain valuable insights into the software development industry. It's also served as a platform for me to showcase my creativity to others
I've learnt a lot over the past 3 months now and I can confidently say that it's one of the easier subject. The tutorials are easy to understand and written in a way that allows me to quickly grasp the concepts. It's also great to see how different coding languages are used in different projects.
